## Abstract

Visual odometry (VO) enables autonomous navigation for land vehicles by estimating motion through visual data. This study compares classical detectors like SIFT and ORB with deep learning-based approaches such as SuperPoint and DISK. Similarly, traditional matchers like FLANN and SNN are evaluated alongside deep learning matchers such as ADALAM and LIGHTGLUE. The study emphasizes trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy under different motion dynamics and environmental conditions.
